        <H1>Aesop</H1>
        <H2>A philosophy to skin care</H2>
        <p>
            Skin is the filter through which we sift and absorb all that surrounds us. Changes in climate, pollutants, medications and other skin stressors upset its delicate composure, and can bring about unwanted changes. Skin is permeable, and as mercurial as our moods. Aesop’s philosophy is to care, protect and not obsess.</p>

                <h2>Skin Care</h2>
                <p>Healthy, glowing skin is the byproduct of a balanced lifestyle, careful cleansing, and appropriate hydration. Genetic and hormonal factors also play a role in skin's appearance, as do climate and pollution, which means that choosing the right skin care products requires careful consideration.</p>
                <p>Aesop's range of soaps and gel cleansers, balms and oils, were born of a desire to make products for the body that were gentle yet effective, and make intelligent use of plant-derived ingredients. We offer products suited to every type of skin. </p>
